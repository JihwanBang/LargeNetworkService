When you run the java process, the directory is p1. 

1. Client 
java bin.Client

2. LoadBalance 
java bin.LoadBalance

java bin.Handler0
java bin.Handler1
java bin.Handler2

To satisfy CLI requirements, we must use a java process per a command window.
(If you want to use all the system (e.g. 2 clients), then you must open 11 command windows)

(Optional) burst data 
If you use the file which is consist of all the instructions, then use “cat [file name] | java bin.Client”.
